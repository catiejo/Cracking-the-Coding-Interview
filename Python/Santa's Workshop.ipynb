    "Ok, so the workshop is back in the black, and we now have a bunch of elves, not just one. But our `fill_santas_sleigh` function still operates the same, and the new recruits are getting bored. Wouldn't it be great if multiple elves could make and wrap presents in parallel? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where threading comes in. Each elf is a thread, and it can either make or wrap a gift. So if we have \"n\" elves, we would want each elf to operate like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there are toys lying around waiting to be wrapped, wrap them and put them in the sleigh.\n",
    "2. If there aren't any toys made, go get a letter from santa and make that wish come true.\n",
    "3. If everything's made, wrapped, and in the sleigh, *exit* the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an important caveat to realize here: if there are multiple elves looking for something to do, they need to do different things. For example, we don't want our little workers bickering over letters or breaking toys because they're both trying to wrap the same one. The solution? Locks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to make sure only one elf talks to Santa at a time, so if Santa is already busy giving a letter to another elf, other elves should quietly wait their turn. We'll call this a `letter_lock`. Similarly, to avoid fights with elves wanting to wrap the same toy (or elves getting hit by toys being thrown onto the pile), only one elf should approach the pile of toys at a time. The other elves *politely waiting their turn*--meaning we'll also have a `toy_lock`. Finally, we don't want elves throwing toys into the sleigh at the same time--they could collide and break! Christmas would be ruined! To avoid this catastrophe, we'll have a `sleigh_lock`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### A quick note on locks...\n",
    "> Locks are really important if the resource you're trying to access isn't threadsafe. Lists are a good example of this, but it's worth noting that there are other classes (queues come to mind) that are indeed threadsafe, so you don't have to bother with locks. Therefore, I'm intentionally choosing a sub-optimal data structure to more completely illustrate how multithreading works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*cough cough\\* With that non-metaphor-fitting blabber out of the way...let's create our own Elf class that is a subclass of Thread (found in the threading python module). During each elf's orientation training (`__init__` for all you programmers), he'll be given a badge with his name, get shown where to find Santa (who has the children's letters), the pile of toys, and Santa's sleigh. He'll also be told about the one-elf-at-a-time policies for each, and finally, given a deadline for how fast he has to complete toys."
