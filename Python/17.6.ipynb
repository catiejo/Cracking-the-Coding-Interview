    "### My Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force\n",
    "The first solution I came up with was a brute force solution. I created an array of every number between 0 and n, and used a radix-style modulo sort to count the number of twos. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass through the array log(n) times (aka the number of digits in n). If the number % 10 is 2, increment count. Then divide by 10 (floored) and move to the next item in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "*After the first pass:*\n",
    "`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n",
    "count = 3 (from 2, 12, and 22)\n",
    "\n",
    "*After the second pass:*\n",
    "`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "count = 7 (from 20, 21, 22, 23)\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is fine to suggest as a starting point, notice that this takes O(nlogn) time and O(n) space. Especially when n gets really large, this could be a pretty major problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizations for this problem would be to start at 2 instead of 0 (since there aren't any 2s in 0 and 1), and to remove elements from the array once they equal zero so you don't go through all the elements every time. Especially if n is a large number, there would end up being a loooot of zero elements. To ameliorate the space complexity, you could also just have a function `findTwosInNumber(num)`, so you don't need to keep an array. This brings the time complexity to O(1) and space complexity down to O(1), so it's pretty significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathemagical\n",
    "A better way to solve this problem is to look for patterns. The insight that helped me solve this problem? What if I wanted to return the number of times a number between 0 and n *ended* in 2? Well, you'd just divide by 10 (floored) with the special case of when the last digit of n is >= 2, in which case you add one more 2 to the count. How about all numbers with a 2 in the 10's place? Similarly, this is n / 100 (floored), but again watching out for the special case where the second-to-last digit of n is >= 2. I realized this approach could be computed by looking at each digit in n, which is O(logn) time! Soo much better than O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a digit, i, that digit will be 2 10^i times the larger part of the number. E.g. 3000 will have a 2 in the 100s place 100 * 3 times. Why? Because of 200-299 that happens every thousand (3 in the case of 3000) times.\n",
    "2. For the special case where that digit in n is > 2, you need to add one more round of 10^i. If the value was 3400 instead of 3000, there would be 200-299, 1200-1299, 2200-2299, AND 3200-3299.\n",
    "3. For the special case where the digit in n == 2, you need to take the normal amount, + any remainder, + 1. So if the number was 3256, the remainder would be 56, so you'd need to add 57 (for 3200 to 3256) to your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this solution is it takes O(logn) time and O(1) space!"
