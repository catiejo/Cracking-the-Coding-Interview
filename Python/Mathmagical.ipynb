    "* The probability of getting exactly n heads (e.g. 2 heads out of 5 flips)\n",

    "\n",
    "In probability, you have an event with k possible outcomes. If you repeat that event n times, you will have k^n total possible outcomes. For example, flipping a coin 3 times could result in hhh, hht, hth, thh, htt, tht, tth, or ttt. This is 8 possible outcomes of the experiment, which is conveniently 2^3 (heads or tails 3 times).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know the probability of an event happening exactly in the order you want, your answer is 1/k^n because, of all the outcomes possible, only one meets your criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't care as much about the order of events, things get more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability of exactly 3 heads out of 5 flips.\n",
    "You have a list, `[heads, heads, heads, tails, tails]`. The chances of getting exactly this outcome is 1/2^5, but if you don't care the order of the events, your chances are actually much higher. It may be tempting to think \"Hey! I can just compute the number of permutations of this list, and divide it by my total number of outcomes to get the probability.\", but this isn't quite the case. If you number the heads and tails, you start to see why.\n",

    "Hmm. Well, another way to think about it is heads1 can happen any of the 5 times you flip the coin, and heads2 can happen any time **except** when heads1 also happens. So instead of P(5, 5) = 120, you get P(5, 3) = 60 possible outcomes. This gets us closer because we're ignoring the tails, but it still assumes heads1 and heads2 are separate events and that we care about their order. Intuitively, you can also tell this is wrong because we only have 2^5 possible outcomes, so 60/32 gives us almost a 200% chance of our desired outcome...\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we don't care about the order...combinations seem like a great candidate. This would divide our 60 possible outcomes by 3! (the number of times we want heads), giving us 60/6 = 10. As our final step, we simply divide by the total number of outcomes to get our probability."

    ">If we have an n element set, we assume there are 2^n subsets of it.\n",

    ">This is the bread and butter of the problem. So let's say we have our 2^n subsets, then we add the n+1th element to the set. This would be all the subsets of n, plus all those subsets with the addition of n+1. For example:\n",
