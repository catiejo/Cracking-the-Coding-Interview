    "While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of *types of cake*, she has an *unlimited supply of each type*.\n",

    "* An integer representing the weight of the cake in kilograms\n",
    "* An integer representing the monetary value of the cake in British pounds\n",
    "\n",
    "You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight, and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `max_duffel_bag_value()` that takes **a list of cake type tuples** and a **weight capacity**, and returns the ***maximum monetary value* the duffel bag can hold.**"

    "This is a really intersting way to optimize the cakes you look for. After all, if a cake weighs less and is worth more, you always prefer that over a cake that weighs more and is worth less--you'd rather take a 4lb, \\$50 cake and have one pound left over than a 5lb \\$40 cake where you'll end up with less money. These dominant cakes can be represented by the [Pareto Frontier](http://oco-carbon.com/metrics/find-pareto-frontiers-in-python/)...the subset of cakes that dominate the cakes that lie beyond it. \n",

    "### What if we had a tuple for *every individual cake* instead of types of cakes? So now there's not an unlimited supply of a type of cake—there's exactly one of each. This is a similar but harder problem, known as the 0/1 Knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes it a bit harder but you can still use the same general approach! Now, since you can't use each element multiple times, you need to write to a temporary buffer to make sure you aren't incorporating that element in the sum. This adds an extra O(n) to create and/or merge the two buffers at the end of each pass, but since our complexity is O(n\\*m), it doesn't affect our bottom line. I actually already solved this problem in one of the In-Flight Entertainment (Interview Cake \\#14) bonus questions, so look there for an example solution.\n",
