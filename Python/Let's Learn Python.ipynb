    "## Errors\n",
    "Python has a lot of different error types, but if you wanna throw your own exceptions, there are two types to rule them all. To signal an unexpected event, you type:\n",
    ">`raise *Error_Type*(\"personalized error message!\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Error\n",
    "Grâce à python's typelessness, you can end up passing objects/values to functions that don't belong. This raises a type error. There are countless examples of this, but here are a few I've found particularly bothersome.\n",
    "* Say you're adding strings to a list, then concatenating that string. If you accidentally add something that isn't a string to the list (totally do-able in python), when you call `.startsWith`, that method won't exist. Cue the type error.\n",
    "* Calling `len()` on what you think is a tuple of ints, but since the tuple only had one value, your variable was assigned just as an int, which doesn't have a `len()` property. Oopsie daisies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if python doesn't throw a type error though, you're still not necessarily in the clear. For example, say you have a function that just computes the sum of x and y. You expect x and y to be ints, so you just say `return x + y`. However, someone decides to download your module and doesn't RTFM (or you didn't write one...shame on you), and tries to use it to sum the values in two lists. This doesn't throw an error since adding two lists just concatenates them, but it doesn't return the expected value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be adding `5 + True`. This will return 6. Why? Because python essentially does `5 + int(True)` => 5 + 1 = 6. No type error, but this is rarely the desired behavior you're going for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, these are the sorts of bugs that can make you tear your hair out. However, as the internet is want to remind us when using python...\n",
    ">*We're all consenting adults here...*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Error\n",
    "A value error occurs when the type is right, but the value is wrong. For example, a function that computes the square root shouldn't take in negative numbers. Or a division function can't divide by zero. "
